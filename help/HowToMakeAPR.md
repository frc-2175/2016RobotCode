# How to make a pull request

Pull requests are a great way to get feedback and advice on your code before it goes into the `master` branch for everyone to use. Here's how you can make one of your own.

## Step 1: Make a new branch

You can do this before you start making your code change or just before you commit.

Click the "Branch" button on SourceTree's toolbar.

In the menu that pops up, enter your branch name and click Create Branch.

## Step 2: Commit and push your changes

Commit your changes like usual, with one exception: Check the box for "Push changes immediately". When you commit, SourceTree will also push your new branch up to GitHub.

## Step 3: Go to GitHub and make the pull request!

Open up the 2016RobotCode repository on GitHub. You will see a message near the top telling you what branches you have recently pushed, and giving you the option to create a pull request.

When you click that button, it will take you to a page where you can create the pull request. Give it a title and description, then click "Create pull request"!

## Step 4: Share it with someone

Once you've created the pull request, you can send the link to a mentor or code captain so they can look over your changes and leave comments. If you have to make changes, you can do more commits and pushes on your new branch and they will be added to the pull request.

## Step 5: Merge it!

When the mentor or captain gives you the go-ahead, you can click the big "Merge" button at the bottom of the pull request.

## Step 6: Switch back to the master branch

Once you're done with a pull request and it has been merged in, don't forget to switch back to the `master` branch in SourceTree. Otherwise, you'll keep adding to your new branch after it's already been merged back in!

Just double-click "master" in the list of branches along the left side of SourceTree.
